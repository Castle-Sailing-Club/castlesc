Building Castle SC's website

This is the repository for Castle Sailing Club's website.  It was built using Haven Consulting's "TrimSite", 
so it's built in HTML5 and CSS3.  It's responsive, and should adapt nicely for phones and tablets, for example.  
It has a simple fix for legacy browsers, but it still needs to be sorted for previous versions of IE.  
Hey guys, it even works in pre-WWW text-based Lynx - so how come Internet Explorer can be sooo broken???
